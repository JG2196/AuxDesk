# AuxDesk

**Plan with purpose. Focus with intent.**

AuxDesk is a minimalist productivity app designed for forward planning and daily focus. Built with Blazor Hybrid, it provides a cleaner, distraction-free way to stay on task without juggling multiple apps, whiteboards, and sticky notes.

## About

## Current Status

🚧 **MVP in Development**

The app is currently in active development. Core features are being implemented and refined.

## Technology

- **Framework**: Blazor Hybrid
- **Client**: Bootstrap
- **Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Android, iOS)

## Vision

AuxDesk aims to be a single source for:
- Forward planning and goal setting
- Daily task focus and prioritization
- Distraction-free productivity tracking

## Getting Started

*(Coming soon - setup and installation instructions will be added as the project progresses)*
